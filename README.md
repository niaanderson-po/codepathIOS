## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

4 of my favorite applications and 2 features that make these applications my favorite are:

Duolingo: (education company)
Diverse animated characters
Home screen streak widget

Arc: (browser company)
Pinch to summarize article
Lift to ear to activate search through conversation

ColorStack Members Profile: (tech non-profit company)
Open source repository for member contributions
Gamified activities board

Pinterest: (social media company)
Skintone range, hair type, and body type search-filtering
Responsive smart feed

An application idea that I would like to build is SoulViynl, a music streaming app with a virtual vinyl record overlaid on black archived content. 
The purpose of this app is a creative archiving outlet dedicated to combatting black historical erasure and deepen users' connection to black cultural upbringings through music's grounding and intergenerational storytelling.
Features I would like to implement are play, pause, and skip controls with Sportify integration, 'smart' matching tracks with relevant archived content ('smart' - stretch goal), and minimize and expand archive descriptions.

## Notes

A challenge I encountered while building my CodePath IOS Introduction App was finding the Adjust Editor Options Button in Xcode since it was an icon with no label. I, however, watched the Connecting Button to Logic clip provided. Once I saw where the icon was located, I was able to proceed with adding functionality to my change background color button.
